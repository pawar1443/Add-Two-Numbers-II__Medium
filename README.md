<h3>this problem is easy to understand but hard to impliment , first we create a dummy node as we have to add elemnt after the dummy node , then we ceate a current node as pointer , then we use a while loop in which we put condition until both l1 or l2 reaches till null. then we declare an x in which we put an if statment to chack weather the l1 is null or not , if l1 is null then initialize 0 and if it have the value then l1.value , sabe for l2 too. then we create a sum variable in which we store the sum of one x+y+( after curr node we also have to initialize carry variable with 0 ) , and then we change carry variable by sum / 10 , we have initiade the sum as in so it will eather contain 0 or any real number not float value  , the we do curr. next cuse it was pointing at dummy elemnt by doning curr.next it will go to first elemnt and then add the digit by sum % 10 . then we increment the x and y by doing if( l != null )l = l.next , we have to do this for both the list l1 and l2 , then we have an exception , what if we have a value in carry variable , the we have to add the value at the end of the list , as by iterating till now the curr pointer is at the end of the linked list we by doing curr.next = new ListNode( carry ); we can add that elemnt at the end , and then we have to return dummy.next , cause dumm is at the start and before the head elemtent.   </h3>
